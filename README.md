# TIDEPool
TIDEPool provides a space for discussing topics and media clubs (e.g., book clubs)

Establishing co-hosts
1) Co-hosts MUST be included on the guest list for the event.
2) Go into Video Options for the meeting (the little gear icon right across from the Google Meet button), and set up the host and co-host settings as you wish
